 The most engaging websites are attractive, intuitive, and easy to navigate— the same goes for nonprofit and charity websites.

Even more importantly, charity websites reflect the nonprofit’s unique brand and mission. Donors should know the minute they land on the website that it belongs to a nonprofit and what that nonprofit is all about!

To help your organization design a compelling website, we’ve laid out six outstanding examples of charity websites from nonprofits just like yours, designed by our in-house experts at Neon One! 

Here are the organizations we’ll look into:

Erie Neighborhood House
Concrete Safaris
Lakewood Service League
International Neighbors Charlottesville
Islamic Scholarship Fund
Women In Toys
We’ll walk you through each organization’s mission and why their charity websites are such a success.
